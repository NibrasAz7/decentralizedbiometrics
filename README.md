# BiometricIdentity DApp README

## Introduction

The BiometricIdentity smart contract, developed as part of a decentralized application (DApp) using Truffle, leverages the Ethereum blockchain for managing biometric identities. It introduces a structured system of subjects and nodes to securely facilitate authentication and enrollment processes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:

- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- Install Truffle globally using npm: `npm install -g truffle`
- Install truffle-assertions for testing: `npm install truffle-assertions`

### Setting Up the Project:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

### Compiling the Contract:

- Run `truffle compile` to compile the smart contract.

### Migrating the Contract:

- Adjust `truffle-config.js` to set up your Ethereum network information.
- Run `truffle migrate` to deploy the contract to the blockchain.

### Interacting with the Contract:

- Use Truffle's development console for direct interaction: `truffle console`
- Example commands for interacting with the contract can be found in the scripts folder.
